    <h1>Pepe Mujica's life </h1>

    <p>Mujica sought and won nomination as the EP-FA’s presidential candidate in the 2009 elections; one of his chief competitors, Danilo Astori, a fellow senator and former finance minister, eventually joined the ticket as the vice presidential candidate. During the campaign, Mujica was the front-runner, but his guerrilla past—which he was at pains to show was well behind him—stirred controversy, as did his public criticism of the leaders of some other South American countries, including Argentina and Venezuela. Although the EP-FA maintained its parliamentary majority in voting on October 25, Mujica did not secure the 50-percent-plus-one share of the vote necessary to prevent a runoff election for the presidency. In the runoff, held on November 29, Mujica defeated former president Luis Lacalle Herrera of the National (Blanco) Party and took office March 1, 2010.

        Under Mujica’s leadership the Uruguayan economy continued to prosper, posting consistent growth in GDP and per capita GDP while maintaining low unemployment rates. Against this backdrop, his administration introduced progressive legislation that altered Uruguay’s social landscape. In June 2012 Mujica proposed that the government legalize and distribute marijuana to cut off revenue to drug dealers. Then, in November, a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives outlining a framework for government regulation of marijuana production, sales, and consumption. By the end of December 2013, the House and Senate had passed the bill, and Mujica had signed it into law. In October 2012 Uruguay had become the first South American country to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy, and in May 2013 Mujica signed a bill that made Uruguay the second country in Latin America to legalize same-sex marriage. Mujica was constitutionally prohibited from seeking a second, consecutive term, but, in much the same fashion that he had ridden into the presidency on the goodwill generated by the Vázquez regime, he was able to return the favour, as the popularity of Mujica’s rule paved the way for Vázquez’s triumph over the National Party’s Luis Lacalle Pou (the son of Mujica’s opponent in 2009) in the November 2014 presidential runoff election. Mujica left office the following year.</p>
